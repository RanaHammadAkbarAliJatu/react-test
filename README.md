# Aliens vs Robots

This is a simple game in which the user adds robots and aliens to an arena for
60 seconds. Whoever has the most mebers after 60 seconds wins.

We're getting code reviewed, and if we pass the review wer get 5 billion
dollars in seed funding to turn this into a MMORPG.

But first we need to improve the app so it passes the review. Please make any
changes you think would improve:

* Performance
* Reliability
* Security
* Maintainability
